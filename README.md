# Perturbation Model for Microexplosion
Hello everyone. This is a code developed by Xinyi for a UGVR project on microexplosion. The basic idea is explained in the poster file.
## Basic wish
Zengbing Yang [2] has detailedly described in his PhD thesis about the perturbation model for predicting the onset of microexplosion.
However, though the model is exact and detailed, the great simulation cost makes it hard to give a fast prediction for the onset of microexplosion. The best way is to simplify it through assumption and approximation. This makes the prediction limited and we need to be careful.
## Model used
Since the whold model is based on the work of Chia-fon Lee's group, we would like to make it clear how it work. Using the equations of momentum, temperature and diffusion, assuming the droplet and all its properties and process are all homogeneous, the equations can be simplified into 3, with boundary conditions. Still, many properties should be decided by the temperature, which makes all equations strongly coupled.
